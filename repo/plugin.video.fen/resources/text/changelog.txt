[B]Please utilize Fen Tips (Tools->Tips for Fen Use) to catch up on any important new features. New features will be highlighted with a [COLOR crimson]NEW!!![/COLOR] label.[/B]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.11[/B][/COLOR]
- Remade Premiumize Cloud scraper to use Premiumize's 'list all' API feature.
- Fixed external search when special character in episode name.
- Fixed correct showing of uncached torrents.
- Fixed Mixed Episode lists not displaying label correctly in some skin views.
- Other fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.10[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Transferring of Uncached Torrents to debrid clouds for Real-Debrid, Premiumize.me and All-Debrid. Select an Uncached Torrent to initiate transfer. File will play upon transfer completion. You can manually cancel a transfer if the torrent transfer rate is too slow. A lot of code inspiration from ResolveURL.
- Added option: Settings->Next Episodes->Appearance->'Cache To Disc'. Defaults to OFF. If set to ON, Kodi will display it's cached version of the Next Episodes list after playback ends, meaning you must back out of and back into the list to update it. Set this to ON if your Next Episodes list takes a long time to load, and you don't need the list updated before watching another show.
- Added 'Refresh' context menu item for Next Episodes list to manually refresh the list if 'Cache To Disc' setting is on.
- Other fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.09[/B][/COLOR]
- Various fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.08[/B][/COLOR]
[I]OK. Let's try this again..... [B]special thanks to Tinuz97 for lots of help testing.[/B]
- Debrid resolving (RD/PM/AD) now handled by Fen. Only Real-Debrid, Premiumize.me and AllDebrid are supported.
- NOTE: You no longer need your debrid accounts active in ResolveURL to use them within Fen. You do, however, now need the debrid accounts authorized IN FEN for the accounts to work.
- NOTE: If you want another debrid service supported, please open an issue on Fen's github and I will add it if possiible.
- NOTE: Currently there is no support for downloading an uncached torrent to your cloud for later playback. This will come soon. At the moment, Fen will skip uncached torrents.
- ResolveURL is still a dependency so free links can be handled, and to get around Openscrapers needing a valid ResolveURL debrid account to use the debrid/torrent scrapers.[/I]
- Fix torrent size filter error causing torrents not to show if size filter enabled.
- Fixed results not showing on some devices.


[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.07[/B][/COLOR]

There is no context menu for the results when this setting is chosen i.e. no "Download File" option will be available, and the label will be single line only.
- Added fetching of fresh watched statuses when marking movie/episode watched during playback. Fen will now fetch this information whilst the movie/episode finishes playing, meaning possibly much quicker refresh times for lists like Next Episode after playback ends.
- Changes to layout of settings.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.101[/B][/COLOR]
- Changed input method for min/max torrent sizes so decimals can be used. e.g. Minimum Episodes: "0.753" will make minimum episodes size approx. 753MB.

NOTE: Please clear External Scrapers cache in Tools->Clear Databases and Clean Settings File to ensure torrent size sorting and filtering works.
NOTE: Size information from torrent results are not guaranteed to be accurate. Also, sometimes size information will not be available.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.97[/B][/COLOR]

- Added 'Use Minimal Notifications' to Settings->Playback->Playback->Autoplay First Relevant Result. Defaults to On. This suppresses notifications during autoplay search and uses background dialog for scraper progress.
- Added 'Ignore Articles When Sorting Lists' to Settings->General->Navigation. Defaults to On. This makes Fen ignore 'the', 'an', 'a' etc when sorting user lists.
- Combined Pagination and Page Limit settings for regular lists and Trakt lists. Combined setting at Settings->General->Navigation. You will need to re-set these settings.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.94[/B][/COLOR]

You can tell FEN how many scrape results a scraper must have stored before it is considered for disabling. Defualt is 25 scrapes. You can also see the current status of enabled external scrapers and choose to manually disable scrapers of your choice by navigating to Tools->External Scrapers->Disable Failing External Scrapers. Defaults to OFF.

- Fixed double instance of 'HEVC' in scrape results info.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.93[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Link TV Show' to Cloud folders. If you utilize the RD, PM, or AD Cloud scrapers in FEN, then you can now assign specific TV Shows to your cloud folders. This is very handy if you have misnamed folders in your debrid clouds, which stops them from being detected by FEN's cloud scrapers. You can now navigate into your cloud files (Premium Services->[YOUR DEBRID ACCOUNT]->Cloud Storage), bring up the context menu on a FOLDER item, and link it to a specific show. FEN will then honor that link when scraping. [B]See FEN Tips for more info[/B].
- Added "Options Menu Style" to Settings->General->Navigation. Choose 'Dialog' or 'Context Menu'. Context Menu is new and will, you guessed it, display the Options menu in the style of a context menu.

- Added setting "Internal Scrapers Order" in Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering. Set the order Fen's internal scrapers will be displayed. Note: 'FILES' in the filter means all physical files found i.e. from 'local', 'downloads' and all 5 'folder' scrapers.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.90[/B][/COLOR]
- Added option in Settings->General->Appearance->Choose Settings Layout to change layout of the settings file. You can choose 'Basic', which removes the multiple submenu system FEN currently uses, or 'Advanced', which keeps the multiple submenus. The default will be 'Basic'. Read more through Fen Tips in the Tools menu.
- Changes to Folder Scrapers settings. Some settings now homogenized between Folder Scrapers.
- More changes to try and fix Subscriptions code.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.89[/B][/COLOR]
- Replaced 'Related' searches for Movies/TV Shows with 'Recommended'. Recommended gives better results, and also gives better results than 'Similar'.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.88[/B][/COLOR]
- FINALLY!! Fixed failed to play dialog popping up at end of playing a fen library item.

- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.87[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Shortcuts' Folders. When in Root, Movies or TV Shows menus, bring up context menu and select 'Edit'. Select 'Add Shortcut Folder' to add a folder to your current menu that you can now fill with other menu items from Fen (including Trakt lists). See Tools->Fen Tips->Shortcut Folders for more info.
- You can now choose whether or not to paginate all Personal Trakt lists (e.g. Collections, Liked Lists) or other personal lists (e.g. Subscriptions, Kodi Library). Settings for Trakt lists found in Settings->Trakt->Trakt Navigation. Settings for other personal lists found in Settings->General->Navigation. This is possible due to TMDb removing the rate limit on their API. Even so, if lists are large then they will load A LOT slower than if they were paginated.
- Include Openscrapers Module in settings cleanup.
- Temporarily implement some logging for subtitle downloads to try and catch a problem reported. It shouldn't spam the log.
- Changed Trakt API timeout threshold to 25 seconds.
- Assign 'icon' to kodi listitems for movies and tv shows.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.86[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.85[/B][/COLOR]

- Search options simplified and remade People search with new options.
- Other changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.83[/B][/COLOR]
- Added All Debrid Torrent Cache check. Be sure to authorize All Debrid in both Fen and ResolveURL to utilize torrent cache checking. Please test and report any bugs..
- Added All Debrid Cloud Scraper. Please test and report any bugs..
- Added All Debrid to 'Premium Services' menu. You can check your account info and browse/playback from your All Debrid Cloud. Please test and report any bugs..

- Changes to after playback code to hopefully solve occasional widgets not updating after playback end.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.77[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Widgets" to "My Trakt Lists". These are a few lists based on your Trakt Collection that can be used as widgets for home pages etc. They, of course, can also be browsed within Fen and exported to other Fen menus if desired.
- Re-ordered settings slightly. There is a new "Trakt" settings tab that includes "Trakt Navigation", "Trakt Widgets" and "Trakt Cache" (Trakt Navigation and Trakt Cache have been moved from the "General" tab. Trakt Widgets includes a new setting).

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.75[/B][/COLOR]

Import it into your root menu by bringing up the context menu on any root menu item, then 'Edit Menu'->'Check if Root Menu has New Menu Items'. Select 'Yes' when Fen asks you do you wish to add 'Sources Scrapers', then select it's position in the root list. If facing problems, you can reset your root list to have it appear.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.74[/B][/COLOR]
EXPERIMENTAL..... Please report any issues in Github.
- Added 'Source1', 'Source2' and 'Source3' to Scrapers. Choose a Movie and TV Show directory for any of these scrapers, and Fen will scan those directories for results (including .strm files from other add-ons) [B]PLEASE SEE FEN TIPS IN TOOLS FOR INFO ON THESE SCRAPERS.[/B]
- Since there are now 5 Internal Scrapers that can be set to search for content before initiating a full scraper search, I remade the pre-scrape function to return all results in a dialog, where you can then choose a result to play before starting a full scrape of all scrapers. Internal scrapers that can be checked for results before a full scrape are Local, Downloads, Source1, Source2 and Source3. If autoplay is selected, any result from these 5 scrapers will initiate immediate playback before doing a full search will all scrapers.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.73[/B][/COLOR]
- Added setting to include uncached torrents in results when checking for cached torrents. Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering->Display Uncached torrents (RD/PM).
- Clean settings will now clean both Tiki modules settings also.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.72[/B][/COLOR]
- 'Clean Settings File' added to Tools. Use this periodically to clear any obselete settings from Fen's settings.xml file. (As a natural part of development of Fen, sometimes a setting will be removed as it's no longer needed. These now obselete settings stay in your userdata settings.xml file. The smaller the settings.xml file, the quicker Fen can run).
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.71[/B][/COLOR]
- Code changes to Subscriptions.
- Added settings to set previous/future days for Trakt Calendar. Found in Settings->General->Trakt Navigation and Cache.

- Added 'Show Biography' to context menu for 'Popular People' lists.
- Some other fixes/tweaks.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.66[/B][/COLOR]
[B][I]CLEAR METADATA CACHE IF HAVING ISSUES WITH THIS UPDATE.[/I][/B]
- Added Language selection to tikimeta. Access through Fen by: Settings-->External(Meta). The language selection is only for metadata, menus/dialogs within the add-on will still be English. Hopefully this can change eventually but it is a BIG job. Metadata will be automatically cleared when changing languages. First time navigation into seasons WILL take slightly longer when language is not English, as extra calls need to be made to the TVDb API.
- Added option to color highlight results based on Scraper or Quality(new).
- Complete refactoring of settings.xml. Settings are now grouped together and accessed by changing the top setting for each tab (most say "CHOOSE SETTINGS..."). Select the group of settings you want to change, and the relevant settings will become visible. I understand this will take a little while to get used to, but the settings from each tab were getting too long, and I hate scrolling down through settings and having relevant settings not visible.
- Added 'Biography' option for People Search. You can now search for Movies/TV Shows, Images or Biography of Actor/Actress.
- Added quick Kodi Log viewer to Tools.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.65[/B][/COLOR]

- [B]Attempting to fix results label bug some users are having (1).[/B]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.61[/B][/COLOR]

- Many code changes in preparation for Kodi 19 Python 3 implementation. (Fen can now be used in a LIMITED way with Kodi 19 Python3. Internal Scrapers work as intended, but External Scrapers are currently broken due to a dependence on ResolveURL, which is not Python3 compatible.) Some functionality is broken with Kodi 19 Python3.
- Changes to Trakt code to hopefully speed up Next Episodes and other Trakt related functions.
- Code changes to fetching watched statuses that hopefully speed up all Movie/TV Show lists.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.57[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Discover Similar' to FEN Discover Movies and TV Shows. Enter the name of a Movie/Show, then enter a year (or leave blank if you don't know), then choose the movie to find similar titles from the list. Browse or Export the list as with other Discover filters. More info in Discover Help.
- Added 'Export Similar List' or 'Export Related List' to context menu when you are browsing results from a similar/related search from within regular Movie/Show menus. You can then export this as a menu item.
- Re-coded trakt related functions.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.56a & b[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'studio' and 'votes' to episode playback info (any info missing from your skin's playback info, let me know).

- Fixed music file downloading.
- Improved subtitle downloading code.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.53[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Animated Posters for Movies. Turn on in Tikimeta settings (KyraDB tab). Off by default. Only enable this if you have a powerful system running Kodi, and have a decent amount of RAM and hard drive space, as Kodi is sluggish when using animated posters, and the posters (GIFS) must be downloaded to the local machine. This means hundreds of megabytes of GIFS. It also means slow initial page loads for movies, as FEN must wait until needed GIFS are downloaded before loading the page. USE AT OWN RISK ON LOW POWERED DEVICES!!
- Clear Meta Cache to start using Animated Posters, or if having trouble after update...
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.52[/B][/COLOR]
- Remade sorting and filtering for results. Some settings moved to accommodate this. External results should now honor sort settings.

- Fixed occasional bug stopping results showing.
- Added dialog reminder to set Fen Subscription folders as a Kodi source when setting Trakt list for Subscriptions.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.51[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Trakt TV Show Calendar to My Trakt Lists.
- Added result numbering directly to labels so it will show numbering during resolving dialog.
- Other code improvements.


[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.50a[/B][/COLOR]
- Increased Trakt default limit for liked lists.
- Fixed label formats (colors etc) not showing correctly for episode items (removed 'Attempt to Make Skin Honor Next Ep Labels' setting as a result).

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.50[/B][/COLOR]
- Re-wrote Fen Subscriptions (Library Integration). Unfortunately, you will have to remake your subscriptions and delete the contents of your Subscription folders.
- You can now choose a Trakt List (Watchlist, Collection, Personal Lists or Liked Lists) in Settings->Subscriptions for both Movies and TV Shows, and Fen will keep your Kodi library synced with these Trakt lists with each Fen Subscription Update. To utilize a refreshed and accurate Kodi library after updates, please enable both the "Update Kodi Library after Subscription Update" and "Clean Kodi Library If Items Removed". This will clear your removed Trakt list items and add the new Trakt list items to the Kodi library.
- Fixed Download for media with special characters, and changed code so media folder is only created after confirming to do download.
- Re-Added cacheToDisc=False to Next Episodes list (will once again refresh after watching an episode).
- Added a new Fen Tips for Subscriptions.
- A fair few other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.49[/B][/COLOR]

- Added 'Clear Progress' context menu item for in progress Movies and Episodes.
- Added Trakt Watchlist cache clear after marking any item watched if using Trakt for indicators.
- Changed setting for HEVC in Autoplay to 'Include, Exclude, Prefer'. Defaults to Include. If your device does not support HEVC(x265), set to 'Exclude' so Autoplay doesn't select a HEVC file to play. If you set to 'Prefer', Autoplay will sort all HEVC files to the top (meaning it will pick a 720p HEVC file to play before a 1080p non-HEVC file if there aren't any 1080p HEVC files).
- Partial re-write of sources.py.
- Added active progress dialog for Torrent Cache Check.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.48b[/B][/COLOR]

- Added second line color choice when using multiline for results. Choose 'No Color' to use the same color as line 1.
- Added 'Refresh Trakt Cache on Each Kodi Startup' to Settings->General->Trakt navigation and Cache. This will clear Fen's Trakt Cache when it is first accessed after a Kodi restart. Fen will then begin to refill the cache with data as needed.
- Re-organized settings for Search. Now split over 3 tabs (Results Display, Internal Scrapers and External Scraper).
- Other small changes to settings.
- Changes to 'Discover' code.
- Discover Movie & TV Show searches each now have their own history. Unfortunately, current Discover history will be lost.
- Improved caching of Furk and Easynews results.
- Added option to clear internal providers (Furk, Easynews) results cache in Tools->Clear List and Data Info.
- Added 'Exclude Adult Results' to Easynews scraper settings.

- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.46[/B][/COLOR]

- Added threading option for main menu items to load them faster (Root, Movies, TV Shows, Music). Off by default. Keep off if turning this on causes problems with menus loading/menu items missing.
- Stopped 'Jump To...' appearing on widget items.
- Stopped 'Resume List Browsing' notification showing when skin loads widgets.
- Slightly reorganized some of the Premium Account Info dialogs.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.45[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Resume List Browsing from Last Viewed Page' feature. Found in Settings->General->Navigation.
- Read about 'Resume List Browsing' in Fen tips (Tools->Tips for Fen Use), but briefly if turned on, Fen will remember your last viewed page number for any Movie/TV Show list you enter, and will re-load that page when you go back to that list again.
- 'Resume List Browsing' data can be cleared per list or all together. Read Fen Tips for more info.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.44[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.42[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Discover' Feature. Make your own lists by setting filters like 'Genre', 'Start Year', 'Rating', 'Country' etc. Browse the newly created list, and/or export it to a Fen Main Menu (Root, Movie, TV Show) if you like, and give it a name. Help found in 'Discover: Help' or go to Tools->Tips for Fen Use->Fen Discover to read up on this new feature.
- From the root menu's context menu, select Edit Menu->Check if 'Root' Menu has New Menu Items to add 'Discover' to your root menu.
- 'Discover' will keep your last 7 days of browsed lists. You can remove a list from the history or clear the history all together.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.41[/B][/COLOR]
- Unfortunately had to remove browsing into Furk Packs from media results. It was indirectly related to vidoes replaying after being stopped. Furk items from a media search will now auto-resolve the correct episode/movie file.
- Added Context Menu item in results to browse Furk Packs as a compromise.
- Fixed videos replaying when stopped.
- Removed Set View options for Furk, Furk Packs and Easynews. Replaced with 'Premium Files' view setting to cover these as well as RD-Cloud and PM-Cloud files.
- Simplified Download Directories. Now just Movies, TV Shows or Premium. If you download something from a Furk, Easynews, RD-Cloud or PM-Cloud listing, the download will go in the 'Premium' folder. If you download something from a media search result, it will go in the appropriate 'Movie' or 'TV Show' folder with proper folder tree structure i.e. TV Show Name/Season/episode_file or Movie(Year)/movie_file.
- Began work on searching for torrent packs with Tikiscrapers. This is a lot of work and will take some time.
- Other fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.40[/B][/COLOR]
- Changes to base code due to changes to tikimeta.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.39[/B][/COLOR]
- Made Cloud Scrapers for Real Debrid and Premiumize. Turn on in Settings->Search or from the 'Options' context menu item when browsing media. You must have your debrid service authorized in Fen to utilize these scrapers. Obviously, these scrapers are dependent on the naming of the folders/files within your cloud. In PM you can rename the folders/files, but not with RD. It's hard to test these scrapers so please report any issues on github.
- Added caching to RD and PM cloud results (cache duration is 2 hours). Clear either cache from their respective 'Premium Services' menu, or from Tools->Clear List and Data Info.
- Some other code improvements.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.38[/B][/COLOR]
- Fix Real Debrid account authorization.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.37[/B][/COLOR]
- Added new Section in the Root menu "Premium Services". Bring up Context Menu on any item in the root menu and select Edit Menu-->Check if 'Root' Menu has New Menu Items and add 'Premium Services'. Or reset the Root menu to default.
- 'Premium Services' contains the Furk and Easynews menus (you can remove the old ones from root menu), plus new menus for Real Debrid and Premiumize where you can browse and play back your cached files and check your account status. You must have your real-debrid/premiumize service authorized in Fen to use these menus. Internal scrapers for these caches will be available soon (hopefully), so they will appear in results when searching for sources.
- Fixed adding Uncached Torrent to Furk.
- Some other code fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.36[/B][/COLOR]

- Added setting to delay setting the viewtype when browsing. [B]Low powered[/B] devices should use a [B]higher setting[/B]. [B]Higher[/B] powered devices can use a [B]lower setting[/B]. Found in Settings->General->Navigation. Range is 100-2500 milliseconds in increments of 100 milliseconds. This fixes views not setting correctly. Adding a delay works with Kodi 18.
- Other fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.30[/B][/COLOR]
- Added item limits per page for all Trakt lists. Default is 40, range is 10-40.

- Fixed non-RD/PM debrid providers not showing torrent results.
- Added setting to show torrent results from non-RD/PM debrid providers when 'cached only' is enabled for torrents.
- NOTE: Fen can only query Real-Debrid or Premiumize to check for cached torrents. If you have another debrid provider as well as one of these two, then you can now choose whether to show or not show those torrent results for that other provider (they are not checked as to whether they are cached).
- Code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.28[/B][/COLOR]
- Added DiscArt for Movies for supported skins (through Tikimeta). To see discart, clear the meta cache by navigating in Fen to Tools->Clear List and Data Info->Clear Meta Cache or in the settings of Tikimeta.
- Added cast information to playback info for supported skins.
- Small code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.27[/B][/COLOR]
- Added multiline support for search results. Enable in Settings->Search->Display Results as Multi Line.
- Code changes.
- Added new Fen Tips for cached torrents.
- One TIP here: Significantly improve scrape times, and be assured of working links, by only enabling Torrent Scrapers in the Tikimeta settings, and showing only cached torrents in Fen's settings. Normal scrape times will be well under 20 seconds, and will show only cached, ready to play links. You must have atleast one of Real-Debrid or Premiumize authorized in Fen's settings and ResolveURL's settings to utilize cached torrents.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.26a[/B][/COLOR]
- Fix for when debrid service/s enabled in Fen but not enabled in ResolveURL. You must have your debrid service/s enabled in both Fen and ResolveURL to see cached torrents from that debrid service.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.26[/B][/COLOR]

- Implemented single hash result caching for cached torrent results.

- Code changes for cached torrent search.
- Other small changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.23[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Real Debrid and Premiumize account authorization in Settings->Accounts.
- Added "Show Cached Torrents Only" (EXPERIMENTAL). You need to authorize your Real Debrid and/or Premiumize accounts in Fen to use this feature. Enable "Show Cached Torrents Only" from Settings->Search->External Scraper->Show Cached Torrents Only. This is experimental, so turn it off if you are having troubles with results showing. Some code used from Seren and ResolveURL. Thankyou to both.
- Added "Show Only Cached Torrents" to Options context menu item for quick enabling/disabling.
- Abbreviated source label for results ('EXTERNAL'-->'EXT' etc).
- Other code work.

- Added Trakt Collections, Watchlists, and Personal/Liked Lists to Trakt Cache. The contents of these lists and the lists themselves are now cached for the duration of your Trakt Cache setting, or if the list contents are changed in Fen. If the list is changed on the Trakt website, or through another add-on, then clear the Trakt Cache for immediate update of info in Fen.
- Added 'Tips for Fen Use' to the Tools section. Go there to read up on tips for certain features of Fen that you may not know about, or don't understand. I'll add more tips as I get time.

Set to a high duration (1 Week) if you use only Fen for media viewing and rarely make changes on the Trakt website. Set to low duration (1 Hour) if you often use other add-ons for media viewing or often make changes on the Trakt website.
- New Tool "Clear Trakt Cache". Found in Tools==>Clear List and Data Info==>Clear Trakt Cache. Also found in "Next Episode Manager". This will clear the Trakt cache if needed.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.12[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed some playback issues.
- Remade and re-added Autoplay Next Episode. Setting appears in the 'Playback' tab once Autoplay has been enabled.

- Added 'Refresh Add-on Icon' to Tools Menu. If I change the icon for the add-on, you can press this to load the new icon. If the new icon doesn't show after, then restart Kodi.
- Some changes to Migration Tool. I will keep the tool around a little longer due to problems with Trakt API on day of performing the rename.
- There will be at least one more update to Furk It (1.2.36), to fix a couple of problems so a stable version is on the github. All future development will be through Fen.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.27[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.26[/B][/COLOR]
- 'Dialog' results display now shows simple results pop-up, instead of extra info like poster etc to speed up the showing of results when 'Dialog' chosen.
- New setting in General/Navigation to enable/disable Kodi's built-in 'cacheToDisc' function. (Enabled by default)
- [B]###INFO FOR cacheToDisc...:###[/B]
    - cacheToDisc is a Kodi setting that makes Kodi cache the directory you are viewing. If you then hit 'next page', and load the next page of entries, then Kodi has the previous page cached so if you hit 'back' it won't need to remake the list items again. It makes backing out of a list of pages quicker.
    - A bug in Kodi 18 means that the cacheToDisc of previous pages don't keep their watched status, meaning any watched media will all of a sudden not display the watched indicator when navigating back to them. Disabling 'cacheToDisc' will fix that, with the trade-off that backing out of pages of media will be slower.
    - This setting does not affect Furk It's caching of information, it just stops Kodi caching pages as you browse. 

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.25[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.02[/B][/COLOR]
- Some fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.01[/B][/COLOR]
- Tried to fix play from library. Hopefully working.
- [B]FURKIT CONTEXTMENU[/B]
    [B]Version 1.0.01[/B]
    - Fixed marking Watched/Unwatched from Furk It widgets.
    - Added 'Browse Series' when brought up from a Furk It widgets episode object.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.00[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed marking episode watched from playback.
- Coded big rework of Download feature.
[B]###INFO FOR DOWNLOADS:###[/B]
    - You can now download Easynews and External source results.
    - For FURK results, you can now download the video file straight from the results page (no need to click through to the t_file page to download the single file.)
    - If FURK result is a PACK, both 'Download Archive' and 'Download File' is available. Choosing Archive will download the entire archive file into the Furk Downloads folder. Selecting File will download the appropriate single file from that PACK. i.e. If you scraped The Walking Dead S01E01, and you select 'Download File' for a PACK result, it will only download the S01E01 file from within the PACK into the 'TV Downloads' folder. Selecting 'Download Archive' will download the entire archive into the 'Furk Downloads' folder.
    - Other fixes.

[B]###INFO FOR TRAILERS:###[/B]
    - Turn on 'Show Choice for all Trailer Videos' in General settings of add-on to enable choosing which Trailer you wish to watch. Trailers are supplied by TMdB, from Youtube videos. I can't get Trailers from an alternate source, for now at least.
    - To get this new feature to work, you must clear the Metadata for movies/shows. Go to Tools-->Clear List and Data Info-->Clear Meta Cache to reset the metadata for all movies/shows.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.88[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.87[/B][/COLOR]

- Added color highlight settings for Furk It Scrapers. Choose colors for all three Furk It Scrapers (Local, Furk and EasyNews).
- Changed 'DOWNLOADING' label to 'ACTIVE' when an uncached torrent is being downloaded by Furk. (Missed that request before.)

- Removed Universal Scrapers Fallback Search option.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.83[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'DOWNLOADING' flag to uncached results that are being downloaded by Furk. Downloading info is cached for 1 hour, but is reset when you add a new file for Furk download, or open My Furk Active Downloads. It is designed to be a visual representation of what Furk is currently downloading for you, rather than necessarily a to the minute representation.
- Fixed number of files display for My Furk Files.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.82[/B][/COLOR]
- Added remove download from list (select file when in My Furk Active Downloads to delete the download).

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.80[/B][/COLOR]
- Preliminary support for Uncached Torrents added. (Uncached currently only available from media search results i.e. through Movie or TV Show menus, not directly through Furk Menus. This will change but I was short of time.)

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.79[/B][/COLOR]
- Added airdate format setting choice (Day-Month-Year, Year-Month_Day, Month-Day-Year). Thanks tknorris, wherever you are.
- POSSIBLY fixed Manage In Progress Shows.
- Fixed 'Include Airdate in Title' from Tools.
- PROBABLY fixed color issues with Next Episode.
- HOPEFULLY FINALLY Fixed Furk API issues on first use.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.78[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed search history. (Moved history to database storage from settings storage. Still don't know why it stopped working.)
- Remade Next Episodes. (Could be buggy, but I hope not.)
- ABOUT NEXT EPISODES:
**It is made to work with either Trakt watched history or watched history coming directly from the add-on. Whichever source you have set up for your watched indicators (Trakt or Furk It), that is the source Next Episodes will use.
** Select 'Include Trakt Watchlist / Next Episode Unwatched' to include the first episode of every show you have in your watchlist.If you're not using Trakt, you can add unwatched shows to Next Episodes via the Add/Remove context menu item that appears for Movies and TV Shows.
** Settings for Next Episodes can be accessed through the normal settings, through Tools==>Manage Next Episode Options or through the Context Menu when inside Next Episodes. I always like to have quick ways of getting to relevant settings. These settings include a 'Manage In Progress Shows'. If you are using Trakt for your watched indicators, then this screen allows you to 'Hide' shows directly through the add-on, without having to go to the trakt site to do it. Shows in the 'Manage In Progress Shows' menu will have [EXCLUDED] in front of them if they are hidden in Trakt, and [INCLUDED] if they are not. Simply selecting a show will toggle it's hidden setting; click a hidden show to unhide it, click an unhidden show to hide it. You can also browse into the show through the context menu if you want to see what episodes you've watched etc. All these options are available if you do not have a Trakt account, Furk It keeps local databases of watched media and hidden statuses etc for people without a Trakt account.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.77[/B][/COLOR]
- Playback changes for proper subtitle support.
- Added multi-year search term for movies.
- Download changes to settings and notification behaviour.
- Settings menus options when navigating through add-on simplified as Kodi 18 does not navigate to a specific setting correctly.
- Reorder settings slightly.
- NOTE: Movie and TV Show search history broken. I have no idea why as Furk Video and Audio history still works and uses exactly the same function. I've given up for today and will fix it tomorrow!

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.76[/B][/COLOR]
- Trimmed Download settings titles, fixed Download folder icons.
- Added Notification options for Downloads (Every 10%, Constant, Off).

- Moved Clearing Tools to Submenu of Tools.
- Added half second delay when opening settings from within add-on (Might fix settings.xml reset problem).
- Change single Download folder to Movie Downloads, TV Show Downloads and Furk Downloads. Each needs to be assigned their own folder in settings.
- ABOUT DOWNLOADS: When getting results from the Movie or TV Show menus, you must navigate down to the final file within any package so as the file saves in the correct folder. i.e. You need the Context Menu to display 'Download File' and not 'Download Archive' so as to save in the correct Movie or TV Show folder. Any file downloaded from within the Furk menus (My Furk Files, Furk Searches etc) will save straight to the Furk Downloads folder, as will any Archive files (season packs or archives from Furk search results).
- Added Download Submenus for browsing new Download Folders.
- Added default tmdb api key. Please replace in settings if you have your own.
