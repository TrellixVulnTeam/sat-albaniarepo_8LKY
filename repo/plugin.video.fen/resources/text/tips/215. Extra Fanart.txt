[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Extra Fanart[/B][/COLOR]
[I]Fen uses the tikimeta module to provide metadata for Movies/TV Shows. By default, tikimeta does not provide extra fanart. To enable this, and start displaying banners, clearart and clearlogo within your skin (where supported by skin), turn on 'Include Extra Art' in the tikimeta settings. You can navigate to the tikimeta settings through Fen by going to Settings->Open Tikimeta Settings. If you have a fanart.tv API key (please consider getting one to support fanart.tv), you can also enter that in the tikimeta settings. Try it out to see...[/I]
